# GenerateActivity
Generate activity on a Windows computer to keep the screen saver from activating. 

## Download
Download the code and extract files from zip or clone the repository using git. 
If you download the code in a .zip file you will likely have to "unblock" the
file before you extract the contents. Otherwise, Windows will prevent execution of the file. 

## Execute .bat script
The .bat script will execute the PowerShell script. The "-ExecutionPolicy Bypass" 
switch should make sure that the computer's PowerShell Execution Policy does not 
prevent script execution.
